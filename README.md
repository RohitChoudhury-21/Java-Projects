I got these tasks from CODSOFT internship training program. These tasks is on learning and developing new skills and gaining hands-on knowledge.
1. ATM interface:
   Create a Java program simulating an ATM machine. It allows users to perform actions like withdrawing, depositing, and checking their balance. The program maintains a user's bank account and validates transactions while providing appropriate feedback to the user.
2. Number Game:
   Create a simple Java game where the program generates a random number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low, and allows the player to continue guessing until they identify the random number. The game may include features like limiting attempts, multiple rounds, and displaying the player's score.
3. Student Grade Calculator:
   The "Student Grade Calculator" is a Java program designed to calculate grades based on marks obtained by a student in various subjects. The program prompts users to input marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject, calculates the total marks, and then computes the average percentage. Based on the average percentage achieved, the program assigns grades to the student. Finally, it displays the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
